# AI-pdf-summary
a simple python script that summarizes a PDF or an URL by a percentage you want.

To use it just substitute "your-api-key" with your OpenAI api-key (sry but i do not want to pay for your pdfs ahahaha).
Then start the software (before u have to install the python packages) and select if u want to summarize a PDF or an URL (Word not supported now)
